# Contributing to PoE-Bot

## Style and Conventions

Until recently, PoE-Bot was maintained and developed by just one programmer. The style and conventions used fit his set
of needs. We are enthusiastic for any and all contributions, but they must fit within the guidelines of our already 
established code culture. Before contributing to the project, please read our [Styles and Conventions](STYLE_GUIDE.md).
Doing so will better ensure that your code gets accepted into the current codebase.

## Getting Started

... make sure we have a label for smaller contributions for new contributors ...

## The Importance of Testing

When this project started, it was small. By some arguments, it still is. Even so, at the initial start it was just 
solving some of our community's needs. As our needs have grown, we have begun to realize the project's own need to be
stable and tested. At this time, we are refactoring to make our code testable. In the future, we would love full code
coverage, but until then, the following classes are covered by tests:

* None

As such, any Pull Request that modifies these classes must have accompanying Unit Tests, Integration Tests and/or 
Behavior Tests. If new tests are not provided, the Pull Request will be immediately rejected and you will be asked to 
add the appropriate tests and resubmit the Pull Request with the new commits.

## Versioning

While we value all of our contributors, it is not the responsibility of our contributors to manage or bump versions. 
Any Pull Request that modifies the version, if not from the project maintainers, will be rejected.
